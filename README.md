- Hi I am Jaiden Mogan and im a sophmore at Southwest Technical and Career Academy. I can work well with others, I like to play 
  videogames sometimes and I think I could be a good game developer.
- My interests in game development include making my own games, or developing my own programs.
- Recently I have been interested in using Unity to develop and carry out my ideas and projects. I've also been tryin to learn how to use 
  Java to code.
